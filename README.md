#Angular phones catalog with Typescript

This is the angular 1.x phones catalog demo. with some small changes

1. It is done with Typescript and not ES5

2. I've added a few features such as the ability to compare number of phones

3.I've styled it a little better (I think) 

This was a good practice for me and I hope it will help who ever will come across it


#In order to make it run

1. Run npm install

2. Run npm start
